Pocket Node is the only Android CKB wallet that runs a real light client directly on your phone. No remote servers, no middlemen — just you, your keys, and the Nervos blockchain.

Unlike browser-extension wallets or custodial apps, Pocket Node embeds a Rust-based CKB light client via JNI. Every balance check, every transaction, every block header is verified locally on your device.

KEY FEATURES

Embedded Light Client
Run a real CKB light node on your Android device. Verify transactions and balances without trusting any third-party server. Your phone connects directly to the Nervos peer-to-peer network.

BIP39 Seed Phrase
Generate a standard 12-word recovery phrase backed by BIP39/BIP44 key derivation (path m/44'/309'/0'/0/0). Your seed phrase is encrypted with Android's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) or StrongBox hardware security module.

Biometric & PIN Security
Protect your wallet with fingerprint, face recognition, or a 6-digit PIN. Authentication is required every time you open the app or send a transaction.

Send & Receive CKB
Send CKB to any address with real-time fee estimation and burn warnings. Scan QR codes to fill addresses instantly. View your full transaction history with confirmations.

Mainnet & Testnet
Switch between CKB mainnet and Pudge testnet at any time. Perfect for developers and users who want to experiment before moving real funds.

Node Status Dashboard
Monitor your light client in real time — see tip block height, connected peers, sync progress, and live logs straight from the embedded node.
